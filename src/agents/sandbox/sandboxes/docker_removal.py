"""Opt-in, host-side removal for private, rootful Linux Docker containers.

Run this service in a trusted process on the Docker daemon host, as root. It uses
host Python workers, not binaries supplied by the container. It does not listen on
a network socket. Give its Docker client only to trusted application code.

Only Docker sessions explicitly configured with this service use its removal
authority. Other backends and Docker clients without the service retain their
existing recursive removal and snapshot restoration behavior.

The service requires a trusted image, Docker 26+ with its builtin seccomp profile,
and the runc runtime. For new client sessions, the service checks container eligibility,
then creates a missing workspace and its parents using the trusted image's default
user before binding, as normal session startup does.
Path-only grant roots must exist at binding time;
the client does not create unrelated grant directories.
Read-only host bind mounts are supported outside the private workspace. Writable
shared mounts, additional capabilities, user namespaces, and missing grant roots are excluded.
The application must exclusively own container lifecycle and Docker API access;
other host administrators are trusted. A service/worker transport failure leaves
the container paused. Before manually resuming it, stop all service workers.

Use one service for the client's lifetime and close it after deleting its sessions.
Binding is live authority and is never serialized. Reattaching a running container
requires the same live binding; a new service must create a new container.

    """Own fixed grant bindings and paused-workload removal on a local Docker host.

    Construct ``DockerSandboxClient(service.docker_client, removal_service=service)``.
    The service must not be shared with untrusted callers or exposed to containers.
    Only newly created, private containers can acquire a binding. Replacing a bound
    canonical root invalidates it; changing its original symlink alias does not.
    Workspace and grant roots must resolve to distinct canonical paths.
    Recursive removal rejects the workspace root and effective external grant roots,
    including their ancestors. Remove their children to clear them instead.

    Create the service on the daemon host, then pass its connection and live service
    to the client::

        service = DockerRemovalService(
            max_concurrent_removals=4, max_entry_visits=100_000, max_cpu_seconds=10
        )
        client = DockerSandboxClient(service.docker_client, removal_service=service)

    Use the normal ``client.create`` and ``session.start`` lifecycle. After use, await
    ``client.delete(session)`` before calling ``service.close()``. Each removal pauses
    all workload processes until it finishes, which can affect concurrent command
    deadlines. Stopped/restarted containers require a fresh session; a binding must
    not be reconstructed from saved paths. Read-only host bind mounts outside the
    private workspace are supported; writable shared mounts and custom security
    profiles are unsupported. Other host processes that can modify mount sources
    must be trusted; pausing the container does not pause host processes.

    Choose resource limits for the host and share this service across the managed
    clients. Calls beyond the concurrency limit are rejected before pausing.
    Each removal child has a CPU-time limit; entry visits include repeated
    visits to ancestors. Reaching a limit may leave a partially removed tree. These
    limits do not impose a wall-clock deadline on stalled kernel I/O. An uncertain
    worker outcome consumes a concurrency slot until all workers have been stopped
    and the application replaces the service.
